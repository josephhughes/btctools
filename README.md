Single SAM
----------
Sequencing error estimates
dN/dS
entropy
Per site entropy 
Per site dN/dS

Comparison between two SAM
--------------------------
Sequencing error estimates - constancy between samples
MacDonald-Kreitman
Randomisation differences


viralbox, vbox, viraltools, â€¦
These are a few suggestions for which I think we already have most of the code.

Analyses from single SAM:
-------------------------
1) Sequence error estimates => plot distribution of frequency estimates
2) dN/dS => single value per gene
3) entropy => single value per gene
4) Per site entropy => plot entropy along each gene and plot sliding window of entropy
5) Per site dN/dS => plot dN/dS along the length of each gene


Comparison between two SAMs
---------------------------
1) Sequence error estimates - consistency between replicates 
2) differences in entropy tested by randomisation => plot of the entropy per site with significant difference in entropy.
